# Remote control for small trains

## Working principle

Use an Pi Pico W to send RF OOSK signals to a decoder
to control various trains (depending on the frequency)
to move.

### Plan
1. Pi Pico W generates a square signal that is modulated into a 400MHz carrier via OOSK containing:
    - A long iddle state so the frame, missing-pulse detector can start sampling data to decode
    - n pulses (1 to 8) that gets decoded by a johnson counter into 1 of 8 possible outputs

2. The signal gets to the receiver board and is demodulated, recovering the original signal
3. The extracted signal passes through a frequency window detector to check if the frequency
corresponds to the given channel
4. If it passes the filter, it goes to a frame detector circuit that activates the counter
5. A missing pulse detector detects when all pulses have arrived and disables the counter
reseting it, as well as asserting the output enable to make the corresponding output visible.
